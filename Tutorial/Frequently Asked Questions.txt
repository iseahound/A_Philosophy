A: Ask yourself before adding any scripts, whether the functionality is needed, or if it could be added
   using a better method, preferably your own. 

Q: Hi, this is me from the future. 
A: Hi! I hope you enjoy this package. Some of these files are as old as January 30th, 2012! That's 2
   years so far. 

Q: Are the files that were not written by you altered in any way?
A: Some of them are. Look for semicolons, and changes in the "header" of the file (like #NoTrayIcon).
