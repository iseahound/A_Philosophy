Try to replace millisecondTimer. 
Also, find an alternative for DrawOnScreen. 



It must have smart guides, for percision alining, and a ruler. A protactor would be nice too. 

-Onscreen ruler, protractor (in pixels, and pixel coordinates)
-Regex Text replacer
-Adding custom .exe files to the path, or starting them in the commandline from where they are available (elevate.exe)
-Convert Googlretranslate into a library. 
-create a separate application integrations file. 
-Figure out how to simulate multi tasking!
