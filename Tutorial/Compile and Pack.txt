===HOW TO COMPLILE AHK FILES==

So you've written a script and want to compile it for all your other computers!
It's rather complicated, since your target machines don't have AutoHotKey. 

NOTE: Run as Administraor

Step 1. 

   Create copies of all the files you want to compile. 


Step 2. 

   Modify those files. 
      -Change all .ahk extensions to .exe
      -Delete those marked with ;c
      -change files from plugin\ to root. 


Step 3. 

   Right click, and compile as 32 bit. Then test them.
   There should be 6 files.  


Step 4. 

   Run "iexpress" in the cmd or run prompt. (From C:\Windows\SysWOW64 for 32-bit)
   Create a new SED file, or import the saved one.
