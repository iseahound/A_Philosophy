The assignment operator = is NOT equal to :=

= This operator simply gives the underlying data a new name. 

:= This operator evaluates the expression and stores it. 


Examples:

   Text = RegexReplace(4cat, ^/d, "")  ;replaces "4cat" with "cat"

   The variable %text% has "RegexReplace(value, ^/d, "")" stored in it. 


   However, if the correct operator := is used, "cat" will be stored. 


   Text = ""

   The value for text is now literally "", or two double quotes and not null. 
   The correct way to assign this is either Text= or Text := "".
